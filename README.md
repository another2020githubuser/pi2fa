# Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+ 2FA

This software provides an alternate 2FA phone number on a Raspberry Pi 3/3B+.  This MVP only receives SMS.
It solves the problem of companies requiring you to add a mobile phone number to your account and then using that phone number for targeting ads, leaking it, etc.  Companies keep doing this.  And I donâ€™t see them stopping.
